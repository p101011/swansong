Blood tubes

    Current Issue:
        Vessels act as binary gates; they either have all blood or no blood
        Thus cannot drain properly (entire system empties on same frame)
        
    Solution:
        Each vessel needs to be more granular
        RL:
            vessel is a tube
            blood coming in must travel full length before leaving
            assuming full blood pressure:
                blood vessel must fill before spilling over to children
            otherwise:
                vessel trickles more
                each frame of liquid crawls along vessel
                vessel should be able to track volume of discrete portions of vessel
                (think DF liquid height)
        tackle in order of difficulty
        ignore blood pressure
        then ignore blood pressure but implement granular vessels
        then use that for blood pressure
        solution should be able to easily accomodate different structure for vessel storage

        solution needs some measure of how full a vessel is
            first pass: single value
            final pass: value for each unit length section of vessel, big artery = more time
        heart is special case
            always gets proper amount of blood
            first pass: always full (0.28 L output)
            second pass: represent all four chambers

        therefore important values:
            current volume
            max volume
            input per frame
            max output per frame

            assume vessel diameter is constant and use for previous values
            input per frame is dynamic, so not state variable
            max volume is constant factor of length
            broken should be handled other than bool, but fine for now
